<h1 align="center">SO WHAT IS UX DESIGN?</h1>
<p>UX design, short for User Experience design, is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on creating meaningful and intuitive experiences for users when interacting with products, services, or digital interfaces. It involves understanding user needs, conducting research, and applying design principles to optimize usability, accessibility, and overall satisfaction. As a UX designer, I strive to combine empathy, creativity, and problem-solving skills to craft delightful and user-centered solutions that enhance the way people engage with technology.</p>
